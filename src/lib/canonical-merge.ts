/**
 * Three-way merge for the server-readable canonical addon store (the D2 "client is
 * the single merger" path).
 *
 * Background: non-Stremio Hubs (Nuvio-only / local-only) expose their addon list to
 * inbound partners (e.g. AIOStreams) through `account_canonical_addons` on the server.
 * That store is the ONE place a writer other than this client can change a Hub. When the
 * client syncs it must fold any inbound changes into `account.addons` BEFORE pushing,
 * or its push clobbers them.
 *
 * Why a three-way merge (not a union or a mirror):
 *   - A plain UNION resurrects addons the user deleted locally (the deletion looks
 *     identical to "remote still has it").
 *   - A MIRROR of the newer side drops additions made on the other side.
 * Only a three-way merge against a common ancestor (`base`, the canonical this client
 * last reconciled to) can tell a local delete from an inbound add.
 *
 * Default policy: inbound adds/updates propagate into the Hub; inbound DELETES do not
 * shrink it (AIOStreams is an add/update writer; removals stay an AIOManager action).
 * Flip with `inboundDeletesShrink: true`. This is the only behavioural knob; everything
 * else is forced by correctness.

 * First-run safety: with no recorded base the client has never folded this Hub, so a

 * client's own last push. Every remote entry is treated as an inbound add and folded in;
 * local deletes can only exist once a base exists to compare against. (The previous
